Last week the [MLS Players Union](https://twitter.com/MLSPlayersUnion) released salary data for the 2018 MLS season. The data's great and does exactly what it says on the tin - it tells you who's getting paid what - but the ability to use this data for any sort of analysis is miniscule in its raw form.

The salary information itself is interesting, but when combined with roster information (e.g. Designated Player information, Senior/Reserve/Supplemental roster slot designations) there's a lot more you can do.

Below is the code that I used to:
- Scrape the [MLS Roster pages](https://www.mlssoccer.com/rosters/2018)
- Clean the roster data
- Merge the roster data with the salary information (albeit through some pretty hacky methods...)

Feel free to re-run the data yourself (you'll need to ensure that you have the CSV of [raw salary data](https://gist.github.com/Worville/1835de67da09a1c17f186c3086511e09) saved in your current working directory). I've included a few comments, but I'd recommend running the code line by line.

This script could definitely be improved with functions and I didn't really go back to re-write any of the earlier parts of this script - but hopefully it contains a few useful snippets you can take away and use elsewhere!

If you don't want to run through the code, and just want to get the data to play with you can find it [here](https://t.co/7py34jC5uL).

Any questions/thoughts, find me on twitter [@Worville](http://www.twitter.com/Worville).
